<p align="center">Project Description</p>

This project utilises elements of the Hadoop Ecosystem and the Tweepy 2.0 API to provide a means by which large retailers such as 'ASOS' can automate online customer support. This project was created to assist me in getting my first junior data engineer role to which it was successful, and I am providing it to assist others aspiring to do the same.
